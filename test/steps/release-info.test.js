This repository uses AngularJS Git Commit Message Convetions[1]
to automatically determine the semver implications of changes
and to generate changelogs for releases.

The following commits could not be parsed:

* [${commits[0].sha.slice(0, 7)}] This ain't no valid commit message
* [${commits[1].sha.slice(0, 7)}] bogus: Not an acceptable commit type

Most likely they are missing one of the valid type prefixes
(feat, fix, docs, style, refactor, test, chore).

You can reword commit messages using rebase[2]:

~~~bash
git rebase -i --root
